An empty starting point for a stateless Ruby API using the rails-api gem, with a React client side app. To fit the definition of stateless, the API does not include action-view, sprockets, or sessions. Roughly speaking, React replaces action-view, Webpack replaces sprockets, and JWT replaces sessions.
